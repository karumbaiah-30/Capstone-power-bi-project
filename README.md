# power bi capstone project
This Power BI Capstone Project for ShopNest Store demonstrates skills in data analytics and dashboard creation, focusing on retail business insights using diverse datasets. The core aim was to calculate the total revenue generated by ShopNest Store while uncovering annual sales trends, patterns, and key business drivers. The assignment required careful integration of datasets, including orders, order items, customer details, product categories, payments, and geolocation information.

The project involved developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, which visually highlights essential metrics such as yearly revenue, top product categories by total sales, and delayed order statistics. Using DAX and Power BI features, relationships between tables were established to enable seamless calculation of total sales, flagging of delayed orders (by comparing actual and estimated delivery dates), and monthly analysis of order delivery performance.

For top product category insights, the dashboard showcased the ten best-selling categories, empowering better product and inventory decisions. The delayed orders analysis identified patterns contributing to delivery inefficiencies, using dynamic visuals and timestamp comparisons. Additionally, monthly comparative visuals illustrated the number of delayed versus on-time orders, supporting operational improvements.

The completed capstone included a detailed report featuring screenshots, clear explanations of each visual, and concise insights for stakeholders. This project highlights advanced Power BI skills, data modeling, and the ability to translate complex retail data into actionable business recommendations for improved sales and operational strategy.
